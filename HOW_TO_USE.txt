• Run setup.bat only once (first time)
• Use run.bat every time you want to run the automation
• The script saves your session, so you may not need to login every time
• Keep the .env file secure - it contains your password
• The automation is optimized for speed
• Browser stays open for 30 seconds at the end so you can review results
• Scraped data is automatically exported to Google Sheets
• View your data at: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_HjbOjlcgwZACo2glY8w-OfUVAGa3TEcX2h5wIwejk/
• Google authorization is required only once (tokens are saved)
